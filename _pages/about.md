## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, advised by Jeffrey Regier. My work sits at the intersection of **generative modeling, probabilistic inference, and AI-driven content generation**. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can move beyond prediction and into creation and interaction.

Before academia, I applied machine learning to finance, media production, and AI-driven storytelling. I led the AI-VFX team for the first feature film in Latin America powered by generative models, proving that generative models could change the way films are made. Before that, I worked as an AI Specialist for Media, helping build one of the first AI-generated virtual influencers.

I believe content consumption should drive content creation, and my research is about making that possible. Consumption begets creation. My work in generative recommenders, AI-powered filmmaking, and multi-modal synthesis reflects this. For my full CV, please refer to [CV](files/PatronGabriel_CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

🔹 **Generative Models**: Diffusion models, flow matching, and score-based generative methods, and their applications to science and media.  

🔹 **Variational Inference & Probabilistic Learning**: Applying Variational Bayesian methods to improve inference speed with theoretical guarantees at the scale of future astronomical surveys. 

🔹 **Personalized Content Generation**: How can we use pre-trained generative foundational media models to move beyond generic recommendation into **adaptive, user-driven creation**.  

🔹 **Recommender Systems**: In the later stage of my PhD, I have developed a keen interest towards recommender systems, and I am excited to incorporate the insights of this field into my own research on personalized generation.
