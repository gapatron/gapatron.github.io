Modern recommender systems follow the guiding principle of serving the right user, the right
item at the right time. One of their main limitations is that they are typically limited to items
already in the catalog. We propose REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs, REBECA, a new class of probabilistic diffusion-based recommender systems that synthesize new items tailored to individual tastes rather than retrieve items from the catalog. REBECA combines efficient training in embedding space with a novel diffusion prior that only requires users’ past ratings of items. We evaluate REBECA on real-world data and propose novel personalization metrics for generative recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REBECA produces high-quality, personalized recommendations, generating images that align with users’ unique preferences.
